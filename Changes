  v0.0.8 pending
      Panic release -- methods have no will to report any progress.

      *   *$ConfigData{timeout}* has been invented.  Default timeout was
          bumped 12x times in order to recover from too silent
          APT-methods.

      *   Hopefully fixing part of FAILs of cpan-testers.

  v0.0.7 20090511

      *   First release.

  v0.0.0 20090222

      *   Initialization.
