  v0.1.11 20140612

      *   Adding speed aproximation.  Changing oscillator; leads to new
          dependecy List::Util.

      *   Attempt to fix two popular FTBFSes.

      *   Rolling back to base; parent has appeared in *v5.10.1* or
          something.

  v0.1.10 20140516
      But-why-god-why release.

      *   It figures qv doesn't have prototype.

  v0.1.9 20140515

      *   Progress exposing route has been made through.  Adding options
          (*$beat* and *$wink*) to control it.  Adding *requires*
          (String::Truncate) to support it.

      *   Attempt to fix any-random-nix-but-mostly-linux FTBFSes (race)
          (probably won't fix anything, read -- introducing new).

  v0.1.8 20140419

      *   Adding *select* callback (*gain* callback looks useless now)
          (AAMOF, it's release excuse).

      *   Attempt to fix linux-but-debian FTBFSes (weird) (most
          probably, won't fix anything; just an excuse to peek into).

  v0.1.7 20140403

      *   Introducing *gain* callback (preparing place for F::AF::S to
          move in).

      *   *$uri* identifies transfer, but *$filename*.

      *   Attempt to fix nix-but-linux FTBFSes (totally my fault).

      *   Attempt to prevent losing diagnostics around non-empty
          *STDERR* (just in case).

  v0.1.6 20140318

      *   Transfer-is-in-progress check is moved to callback.  What
          could be user-provided.  Introducing *$ConfigData{tick}* and
          changing *$ConfigData{timeout}* handling.

      *   Another attempt to fix got-''-expected-'{{{TERM}}}' build
          errors (guesswork).  Another attempt to fix
          got-'1'-expected-'' build errors (being *@$log* filled with
          yet-to-be-processed message or empty isn't reliable anymore).

      *   Adding unit with required manual configuration (slow
          inter-device copy).  That's the very first torturing unit,
          please welcome.

      *   Investigating weird compatibility problem (two units:
          t/0/EmMn8o.t and t/0/9raCtd.t).

  v0.1.5 20140226

      *   Trying to test minimally implemented File::AptFetch::Simple.

      *   Attempt to fix got-''-expected-'{{{TERM}}}' build errors
          (guesswork).  Attempt to fix got-'1'-expected-'' build errors
          (probably, in vein).  Attempt to fix unexpected locale
          settings build errors.

  v0.1.4 20140209
      F::AF::S pre-release.

      *   *$ConfigData{apt_source}* parser has been rewriten: accepting
          new config entries, more strictures.

      *   Incompatible change! Message parser has been rewritten: long
          promised changing hyphens to underscores, more strictures.

      *   Pipe reader has been rewritten: runs on select(2), eval has
          been dropped; side effect -- all possible messages are read at
          once (not one-by-one, as before).  Probable regression (may be
          there's none): what if a message is that big that it doesn't
          fit in buffer?

      *   TS has been reloaded.  Ridiculous "INIT { use_ok }" has been
          dropped from t/0.t.

      *   Attempt to declare legal stuff correctly without dependecies
          boosting.  (v0.1.5 -- nope.)

  v0.0.9 20101205
      Mostly cosmetic change (one underscore added in
      _cache_configuration parsing re) in order to work with APT of
      squeeze.

      *   Requiring perl of v.5.8.0 at minimum.

      *   Playing with POD in diags has been plain stupid.

      *   Misguided attempt to survive the die of "Interrupted system
          call" (btw, TS only, F::AF is still affected).

      *   Misguided attempt to fix missing log of signaling tests.

      *   Adding simplest test-unit that's run first and BAIL_OUTs for
          any reason.

  v0.0.8 20101125
      Panic release -- methods have no will to report any progress.

      *   *$ConfigData{timeout}* has been invented.  Default timeout was
          bumped 12x times in order to recover from too silent
          APT-methods.

      *   Hopefully fixing part of FAILs of cpan-testers.

  v0.0.7 20090511

      *   First release.

  v0.0.0 20090222

      *   Initialization.
