=head1 NAME

File::AptFetch - perl interface onto APT-Methods

=head1 SYNOPSIS

# TODO:

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Shortly:

=over

=item *

Methods are usual executables.
Hence B<F:AF> forks.

=item *

There's no command-line interface for methods.
The IPC is two pipes (I<STDIN> and I<STDOUT> from method's POV).

=item *

Each portion of communication (named B<message>) consists of numerical code
with explaining text and a sequence of colon (C<':'>) separated lines.
A message is terminated with empty line.

=item *

L<File::AptFetch::Cookbook> has more.

=back

I<(disclaimer)>
Right now, B<F::AF> is in "proof-of-concept" state.
It surely works with local methods (F<file> and F<copy>);
I hope it will work with trivial cases of remote methods
(I<v0.1.9> I've left to hope, it totally does;
no manual interaction (credentials and/or tray closing) provided).
(B<F::AF> has no means to accept (not talking about to pass along)
authentication credentials;
So if your upstream needs authentication, B<F::AF> is of no help here.)
And one more warning:
you're supposed to do all the dirty work of managing --
B<F::AF> is only for comunication.
Hopefully, there will be someday a kind of super-module what would simplify all
this.

I<(warning)>
You should understand one potential tension with B<F::AF>:
B<wget(1)>, B<curl(1)>, various FTP clients, or whatever else that constitutes
B<fetcher> are (I hope so) thoroughly tested against monkey-wrench on the other
side of connection.
APT methods are B<not>.
APT talks to repositories;
those repositories are mostly mirrors.
Administrators of mirrors and mirror-net roots have at least a basic clue.
Pending discovery of APT methods behaviour when they face idiots on the other
side of connection.

There's a list of known bugs, caveats, and deficiencies.

=over

=item *

(I<v0.1.9>)
There were some concerns about signals.
Surprisingly, they're gone now.
The only corner left to try is a child ignoring signals at all
(stuck in syscall?).

=item *

That seems that upon normal operation there're no zombies left.
However, I'm not sure if B<waitpid> would work as expected.
(What if some method would take lots of time to die after being signaled?)

=item *

Methods are supposed (or not?) to write extra diagnostic at its I<STDERR>.
It stays the same as of your process.
However, I still haven't seen any output.
So, (first) I (and you) have nothing to worry about
and (second) I have nothing to work with.
That's possible that issue will stay as caveat.

=item *

I<@$log> is fragile.
Don't touch it.
However, there's a possibility of I<@$log> corruption, like this.
If method goes insane and outputs unparsable messages, then L</gain()> will
give
up immedately leaving I<@$log> unempty.
In that case you're supposed to recreate B<F::AF> object (or give up).
If you don't then strange things can happen (mostly -- give-ups again).
So, please, do.

=item *

I<@$diag> grows.
In next release there will be some means to maintain that.
Right now, clean I<@$diag> yourself, if that becomes an issue.

=item *

You're supposed to maintain a balance of requests and fetches.
If you try L</gain()> when there's no unfinished requests,
then method will timeout.
There's nothing to worry about actually except hanging for 120sec.

=back

B<(note)>
Documentation of this library must maintain 4 namespaces:

=over

=item Function/method parameter list (I<@_>)

Within a section they always refer to parameter names and keys
(if I<@_> is hash)
mentioned in nearest synopsis.

=item Explicit values in descriptive codes

They always refer to some value in nearest code.
C<$method>, C<$?> etc means that
there would be some value that has some relation with named something.
POD markup in descriptions means exactly that.

=item Keys of B<File::AptFetch> B<bless>ed object

Whatever missing in nearest synopsis fits here.
Each key has explicit content dereference attached.
So I<@$log> means that key named C<log> has value of C<ARRAY> reference,
I<%$message> has value of C<HASH> reference,
and I<$status> has value of plain scalar
(it's not reference to C<SCALAR>, or it would be I<$$status>).

=item Keys of B<File::AptFetch::ConfigData> configuration module

Within each section upon introducing they are explicitly mentioned as such.
The above explanation about explicit dereference applies here too.

=back

B<(note)>
B<Message headers> are refered as keys of some fake global I<%$message>.
So C<Filename> becomes I<$message{filename}>,
and C<Last-Modified> -- I<$message{last_modified}>.
I hope it's clear from context is that B<header> down- or up-stream.

B<(note)> Through out this POD "log item" means one line in I<@$log>;
"log entry" means sequence of log items including terminating empty item.

B<(note)>
Through out this POD "120sec timeout" means: "I<$timeout> in
B<File::AptFetch::ConfigData> being left as set in stock distribution,
overriden while pre-build configuring, or set at run-time".

=head1 IMPORTANT NOTE ON B<PERL-5.10.0>

It's neither bug nor caveat.
And it's out of my hands, really.
B<perl-5.10.0> exits application code differently if compared with
B<perl-5.10.1> (unbelievable?).
My understanding is that B<v5.10.0> closes handles first, then B<DESTROY>s.
Sometimes that filehandle closing happens in right order.
But most probably application is killed with I<$SIG{CHLD}>.
B<END{}> doesn't help --- that filehandle masacre happens before those blocks
are run.
I believe, whatever tinkering with the global I<$SIG{CHLD}> is a bad idea.
And terminating every method just after transfers have finished is same
stupid.
Thus, if you run B<perl-5.10.0> (probably any earlier too) destroy the
B<File::AptFetch> object explicitly before B<exit>ing app, if you care about
to be not I<$SIG{CHLD}>ed.

=head1 METHODS

=over

=cut

=item B<init()>

    ref( my $fetch = File::AptFetch->init( $method )) or die $fetch;

That's an initialization stuff.
APT-Methods are userspace executables, you know, hence it B<fork>s.
If B<fork> fails, then it dies.
If all preparations succeede, then it returns B<File::AptFetch> B<bless>ed
object;
Otherwise a string describing issue is returned.
Any diagnostic from B<fork>ed instance and, later, B<exec>ed I<$method> goes
through C<STDERR>.
(And see L</_cache_configuration()>.)

An idea behind this ridiculous construct is that someday, in some future, there
will be a lots of concurency.
Hence it's impossible to maintain one package-wide store for fail description.
All methods of B<File::AptFetch> return descriptive strings in case of errors.
B<init()> just follows them.

I<$method> is saved in same named key for reuse.

Give-up codes:

=over

=item ($method): (lib_method): neither preset nor found

I<$lib_method> (in B<File::AptFetch::ConfigData>) points to a directory where
APT-Methods reside.
Without that knowledge B<File::AptFetch> has nothing to do.
It's either picked from configuration (build-time) or from B<apt-config> output
(run-time) (in that order).
It wasn't found in either place -- fairly strange APT you have.

=item ($method) is unspecified

I<$method> is required argument,
so, please, provide.

=item ($method): ($?): died without handshake

Start-up configuration is essential.
If I<$method> disconnects early, than that makes a problem.
The exit code (no postprocessing at all) is provided in braces.

=item ($method): timeouted without handshake

I<$method> failed to configure within time frame provided.
(I<v.0.0.8>)
L</_read()> has more about timeouts.

=item ($method): ($Status): that's supposed to be (100 Capabilities)

As described in "APT Method Interface", Section 2.2, I<$method> starts with
S<C<'100 Capabilities'>> Status Code.
I<$method> didn't.
Thus that's not an APT-Method.
B<File::AptFetch> has given up.

=back

Yet refer to L</_parse_status_code()>, L</_parse_message()>, and
L</_cache_configuration()> -- those can emit their own give-up codes
(they are passed up immediately by B<init()> without postprocessing).

Cleanups.
A method is B<kill>ed and B<waitpid>ed, pipes are explicitly closed.
I anything goes wrong then B<carp>s, for obvious reasons.
B<waitpid> is unconditional and isn't timeout protected.

The actual signal sent for I<$pid> is configured with I<$signal> in
B<File::AptFetch::ConfigData>.
However one can override (upon build time) or
explicitly set it to any desired name or number (upon runtime).

B<(bug)>
In that section abbreviation "URI" actually refers to "scheme-specific-part".
Beware.

That files requests for transfer.
Each request is a pair of I<$target> and either of

=over

=item I<$source>

Simple scalar;
It MUST NOT provide schema -- pure filename (either local or remote);
It MUST provide all (and no more than) needed leading slashes though
(double slash for remotes).

I<$source> is preprocessed -- I<$method> (with obvious colon) is prepended.
(That seems, APT's method become very nervous if being requested mismatching
method's name schema.)
B<(bug)> That requirement will be slightly relaxed in next release.

=item I<%$source> C<HASH> ref

Such keys are known

=over

=item I<$uri>

The same requirements as for I<$source> apply.

=back

There're other keys yet that must be supported.
Right now I unaware of any
(pending real-life testing).

=back

(I<v0.1.5>)
If request list is empty then silently succeeds without doing anything.

Actual request is filed at once (subject to buffering though),
in one big (or not so) chunk (as requested by API).
I<@$diag> field is updated accordingly.

Give-up codes:

=over

=item ($method): ($filename): URI is undefined

Either I<$source> or I<$source{uri}> was evaluated to FALSE.
(What request is supposed to be?)

B<(caveat)>  While C<undef> and empty string are invalid URIs,
is C<0> a valid URI?
No, URI is supposed to have at least one leading slash.

=back

B<request()> pretends to be atomic,
the request would happen only in case I<@_> has been parsed successfully.

=item B<gain()>

That gains something.
'Something' means it's unknown what kind of message APT's method would return.
It can be S<'URI Start'>, S<'URI Done'>, or S<'URI Failure'> messages.
Anyway, message is stored in I<@$diag> and I<%$message> fields of object;
I<$Status> and I<$status> are set too.

Give-up codes:

=over

=item ($method): ($CHLD_error): died

Something gone wrong, the APT's method has died;
More diagnostic might gone onto I<STDERR>.
Even if I<$CHLD_error> is C<0> the method still died on us --
it's not supposed to exit.

=item ($method): timeouted without responce

The APT's method has quit without properly terminating message with empty line
or failed to output anything at all.
Supposedly, shouldn't happen.
Otherwise, that's your fault -- you asked for entry without reason.

=item ($method): timeouted

The APT's method has sat silently all the time.
The possible cause would be you've run out of requests
(than the method has nothing to do at all
(they don't tick after all)).

=back

L</_parse_status_code()> and L</_parse_message()> can emit their own give-up
codes.

Unless any problems just before B<return> C<gain> callback is tried (if any).
That CODE is given the object as an argument.
There's no default callback.
RV is ignored;
B<(note)> That might change in future, beter return TRUE.

What if a method yelds C<Foo-Bar:> and C<Foo_Bar:> headers?
(C<RFC2822> headers are anything but space and colon after all.)

But those headers are different and should be handled appropriately.
They aren't.

Give-up codes:

=item ($method): ($log_item): message must be terminated by empty line

APT method API dictates that messages must be terminated by empty line.
This one is not.
Shouldn't happen.

=item ($method): ($log_item): that resets header ($header)

The leading message header (I<$header>) has been seen before.
That's a panic.

Shouldn't happen.

=item ($method): ($log_item): that's not a Message

B<fork>s.
B<die>s if B<fork> fails.
B<fork>ed child B<exec>s an array set in I<@$config_source>
(from B<File::AptCache::ConfigData>).
If I<$ConfigData{lib_method}> is unset,
then parses prepared cache for I<Dir::Bin::methods>
item and (if finds) sets I<$lib_method>.
It doesn't complain if I<$lib_method> happens to be left unset.
If cache is set it B<return>s without any activity.

I<@$config_source> is subject to the build-time configuration.
It's preset with S<C<qw[ /usr/bin/apt-config dump ]>>
(YMMV, refer to B<F::AF::CD> to be sure).
I<@$config_source> must provide reasonable output -- that's the only
requirement
(look below for details).

B<(bug)>
While I<@$config_source> is configurable all give-up codes and
diagnostic messages refer
to C<'apt-config'>.

I<@$config_source>'s output is postprocessed --
configuration names and values are stored as equal (C<'='>) separated pairs in
scalars and pushed into intermediate array.
If everything finishes OK, then the package-wide cache is set.
That cache is lexical
(that's possible, I would find a reason to make some kind of iterator some time
later;
such iterator is missing right now).

(I<v0.1.2>)
Parsing cycle has suffered total rewrite.
First line is split on space into I<$name> and I<$value> (or else).
Then comes validation
(it woulnd't be needed if I<@{$ConfigData{config_source}}> would be
hardcoded, it's not):
* I<$name> must consist of alphanumerics, underscores, pluses, minuses,
dots, colons, and slashes (C<qr[\w/:.+-]>) (or else);
* (that's an heuristic) colons come in pairs (or else);
* I<$value> must be double-quote (C<">) enclosed, with no double-quote
inside allowed (or else);
* there must be terminating semicolon (C<;>) (or else).
Then comes cooking (all cooking is found by observation, it mimics APT-talk
with methods):
* trailing double pair-of-colons in I<$name> is trimmed to single pair;
* every space in I<$value> is percent escaped (C<%20>);
* every equal sign in I<$value> is percent escaped (C<%3d>).

That last one, needs some explanation.
B<apt.conf(5)> clearly states:
"Values must not include backslashes or extra quotation marks".

    apt-config dump | grep \\\\

disagrees on backslashes (if you're upgraded enough).
So does B<F::AF>: backslashes are passed through.
After some experiments double-quote handling looks, roughly, like this:
* double-quotes must come in pairs;
* those double-quotes are dropped from I<$value> withouth any visible effects
(double-quotes, not enclosed content;
it stays intact;
whatever content, empty string is content too);
* if there's any odd double-quote that fails parsing.
B<F::AF> doesn't need to do anything about it --
I<@{$ConfigData{config_source}}> is supposed to handle those itself.

B<(bug)>
What should be investigated:
* what if double-quote is explicitly percent-escaped in F<apt.conf>?
* how percents in I<$value> are handled?
Pending.

=item empty-line separator has been found

(I<v0.1.9> there was major breakage at that point after I<v0.1.4>)
Somewhere in I<@$log> there's, at least one, empty-line separtor.
For technical reasons it doesn't have to be the last one.
For more confusion the last item might be unempty.
It's up to you would you consume everything in I<@$log>,
complete entries (with empty-line separtors), or
only first complete entry --
B<_read> doesn't care.
In either case, you may be sure if B<_read> returns clean (see below) there's
at least one compelte entry.

=item child has timeouted

If child timeouts, then I<$ALRM_error> is set
(to TRUE, otherwise meaningles).
Technically speaking a method just has nothing to say.
It's up to caller to decide what to do
(and it's caller's fault that there was attempt to get entry while there was
no reason to be any).
Anyway, I<$ALRM_error> is forced to be FALSE upon entering B<select> loop.

(I<v0.0.8>)
And more about what timeout is.
It was believed, that methods pulse their progress.
That belief was in vain.
Thus for now:

=over

=item *

The timeout is configurable through I<$ConfigData{timeout}>
(120sec, by stock configuration;
no defaults.)
The timeout is cached in each instance of B<File::AptFetch> object.

=item *

I<(v0.1.6)>
Target filenames are cached in the B<F::AF> object.
For each target there's a HASH.
In the HASH a key I<filename> is set to target filename value.

=item *

I<(v0.1.4)>
Timeout (the big one I<$timeout>) is made in supposedly small
I<$ConfigData{tick}>s
(5sec, by stock configuration;
no defaults.)
The small timeout is made with 4-arg B<select>.

=item *

I<(v0.1.6)>
If there's no input from method then routing is made as follows:

=over

=item +

Each target's cached HASH is passed to C<read> callback
(L</set_callback()> has more).

=item +

If any callback returns TRUE then resets timeout counter and
goes for next I<$tick> long B<select>
(IOW, file transfer (whatever that means) is in progress).

=item +

If every callbacks return FALSE then advances to timeout and
goes for next I<$tick> long B<select>.

=item +

I<(not implemented)>
If any callback returns C<undef> then fails entirely.

=back

=back

=item child has exited

The child is B<waitpid>ed and then I<$CHLD_error> is set.
It's possible that's normal for child to exit --
it's up to caller to decide.
Anyway, after child has exited there's nothing to B<read> from.

=item unknown error has happened

(I<v.0.1.4>)
It used to be read-with-alarm-in-eval.
It's not anymore, thus any B<signal(7)> will kill a process.
Then it dies.

=item B<_read_callback()>

I<(v0.1.6)>
Internal.
It's a default I<read> callback
(L</B<_read()>> has more).
It was supposed to be simple.
In vain.

The primary objective is avoiding false negatives at all cost.
Here comes list of avoided false negatives:

=over

=item *

Somewhere on C<lenny>/C<squeeze> time-span APT methods have changed behaviour.
In past they opened target for writing instantly.
Now they create a temporal and upon finishing rename it to target.
For obvious reasons methods do not communicate neither progress nor filename
of temporal.
If naming or handling of unfinished transfers would ever change there will be
breakage.

=item *

Then.
When transfer is finished *physically* it's not reported just yet
(temporal has been renamed).
A method calculates hashes.
For obvious reasons methods do not coummunicate progress either.
Naive approach would be to check size and then just wait forever.
That's possible size isn't known beforehand.
So B<_read_callback()> increases number of ticks before signaling timeout.
That increase is function of tick length (I<$ConfigData{tick}>), current file
size, and supposed IO speed.
The IO speed is hardcoded to be 15MB/sec.
So if media is realy slow (like a diskette or something) there's a possibility
of breakage.
However, those nitty-gritty manipulations won't result ever in timeout
decrease.

=back

For now it's not clear if B<_read_callback()> ought to provide some
diagnostics.
Right now it doesn't.
